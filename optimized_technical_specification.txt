## Optimized Technical Specification: Payment Protocol Integration

**Objective:** Integrate a selected payment protocol (e.g., x402) into the "NeuroExpert" platform to ensure secure and efficient transactions related to AI agent monetization and user balance management.

**Current State:** The platform lacks built-in support for external payment protocols, except for a contact form to reach a manager.

**Required Changes:**

1. **Research and Selection of Protocol:**
   * **Task:** Thoroughly study the documentation of the x402 protocol (or another selected protocol if x402 is unsuitable or there are more optimal options) to understand its architecture, API, authentication, authorization, and transaction processing methods.
   * **Outcome:** A report on the selected protocol, its capabilities, limitations, and necessary steps for integration.

2. **Backend Integration Development:**
   * **Task:** Create or adapt existing backend APIs to interact with the selected payment protocol.
   * **Functionality:**
     * **Transaction Initiation:** API for sending requests to top up the user's balance via the protocol.
     * **Callback/Webhook Handling:** Mechanism for receiving notifications from the protocol about transaction status (success, failure, pending).
     * **Balance Management:** API for updating the user's internal balance on the platform according to protocol data.
     * **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement security mechanisms to protect transactions and user data.
     * **Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of all interactions with the payment protocol for debugging and auditing.
   * **Technologies:** Use the existing backend stack (e.g., Python/Flask, if used) for developing these APIs.

3. **Frontend Integration Development:**
   * **Task:** Integrate the payment protocol functionality into the platform's user interface, ensuring convenience and security for users.
   * **Functionality:**
     * **Balance Top-up:** UI elements (buttons, forms) for initiating balance top-up. Users should be able to enter the amount and select a payment method (if the protocol supports multiple).
     * **Transaction Status Display:** Notifications and indicators to inform the user about the progress and result of the transaction.
     * **Transaction History:** Component for displaying a list of all user transactions, including date, amount, status, and operation type.
     * **Wallet Integration:** If the protocol involves using an external crypto-wallet, provide a UI for its connection and interaction.
   * **Integration Location:** Primarily in the `PricingCalculator.js` component (after its adaptation) and on a new user dashboard.

**Expected Code Changes:**

* **Backend:** Creation of new routes/controllers/services for protocol interaction. Installation of SDK or libraries for protocol operation may be required.
* **Frontend:** Modification of `PricingCalculator.js`, creation of new React components (e.g., `WalletConnect`, `TopUpForm`, `TransactionHistory`) and their integration into `app/page.js` or a new dashboard.

**Dependencies:**

* Documentation of the selected payment protocol.
* Developed backend for handling protocol requests.
* Adapted `PricingCalculator.js` component.

**Expected Outcome:** The "NeuroExpert" platform will be able to securely and efficiently process financial transactions through the selected payment protocol, providing users with a convenient way to top up their balance and pay for AI agent services.
