## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at NeuroExpert. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### üö® How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at: security@neuroexpert.ai
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability
   - Full paths of source file(s)
   - Location of affected code
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the issue

### üìÖ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution Target**: 
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 3-5 days
  - Medium: 1-2 weeks
  - Low: Next release

## Security Measures

### üõ°Ô∏è Current Security Features

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - bcrypt password hashing
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Session management

2. **Data Protection**
   - Environment variable management
   - Encrypted sensitive data at rest
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - SQL injection prevention

3. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting
   - CORS configuration
   - Input validation
   - API key management

4. **Infrastructure**
   - Security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Automated security scanning
   - Docker security best practices

### üîê Security Best Practices

#### Environment Variables

```bash
# Never commit .env files
# Use strong, unique values
# Rotate keys regularly
# Use different keys for each environment
```

#### Password Requirements

- Minimum 12 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- No common dictionary words
- Regular password rotation

#### API Key Management

```javascript
// Good practice
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
if (!apiKey) {
  throw new Error('API_KEY is required');
}

// Never do this
const apiKey = 'sk-1234567890abcdef'; // NEVER hardcode
```

### üö´ Known Security Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Never commit secrets**
   ```javascript
   // BAD
   const password = 'admin123';
   
   // GOOD
   const password = process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD;
   ```

2. **Always validate input**
   ```javascript
   // BAD
   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${req.params.id}`;
   
   // GOOD
   const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?';
   db.query(query, [req.params.id]);
   ```

3. **Use HTTPS everywhere**
   ```javascript
   // Enforce HTTPS in production
   if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
     app.use(requireHTTPS);
   }
   ```
